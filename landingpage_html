<p class="beskrivelseafvideo">When the ice on the poles melts, where will all the polar bears live? When you throw your trash on the ground and don’t pick it up, you’re not just hurting the planet and all the animals on it; you’re also hurting your future planet and its peoples future. This campaign is in cooperation with the UN's SDGs.</p>
