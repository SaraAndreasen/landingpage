    <p>There are several rainforests around the earth, the largest one is the Amazonian Rainforest, located in 8 different countries, including Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. The Amazon occupies an area of ​​6.7 million square kilometers, 155 times larger than Denmark. There are rainforests in South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. All rainforests are tropical rainforests which have very high temperatures and high humidity, which means that it often rains within the forest. That’s why we call them rainforests. Rainforests are found around the equator, which is the line created between the north and south pole.
Did you know that in the past the land was covered by 14% rainforest and now it is only covered by 6%? As many as 8% of the world's rainforests have been felled for agricultural use or there is room for palm oil plantations. The rainforest is important for everyone, yet no one cares for it. We humans need trees to protect the climate by converting CO2 into oxygen. The rainforest is also home to many different animal species, some of which are going extinct. We aren’t just taking their home by cutting down the rainforest. We’re also taking the home of various tribes that live within the rainforest. Many items that people here in Denmark buy during their daily lives are a product of the rainforest, such as cocoa, bananas, bamboo, etc. These items are things most would prefer to keep using and eating, but yet no one seems to care that the rainforest is dying.
We cut down the equivalent of 36 football fields of rainforest every single minute. Few do fortunately cut down trees in a sustainable way, where they plant as many trees as they cut down. The brand FSC do this, so if you need wood or paper make sure it is FSC marked. </p>
